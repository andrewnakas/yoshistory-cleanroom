# Yoshi's Story — clean-room web build

You are running **unattended overnight**. The user prompts once (decomp link, ROM path) and checks in the morning. Work autonomously: decide with the defaults below, log every decision in `STATUS.md`, and never stop to ask unless something is truly blocking (then write the question in STATUS.md and continue with anything else).

## Goal
A playable **web build** of Yoshi's Story, built from the community decomp, where **every asset the decomp extracts from the ROM is regenerated** (clean room), published as `andrewnakas/yoshistory-cleanroom` + GitHub Pages. Same result as Super Mario 64 (https://andrewnakas.github.io/sm64-cleanroom/) and Pilotwings 64.

## Priorities tonight (user's words: "get all the visuals and gameplay and images/sprites correct")
1. Game boots and is playable in the browser (keyboard + gamepad), audio engine working (no dropouts).
2. **Everything readable**: fonts, HUD, dialog, text inside textures (re-typeset).
3. **Faces, sprites, pictures correct**: eyes/mouths/portraits/icons/sprites via briefs (`cleanroom.gfx.facepaint`), illustrations via renders of the game's own geometry (`cleanroom.gfx.c_render`), HUD widgets drawn per state.
4. Textures: kept colour grid + alpha outline (default), better where it matters.
5. Voices: **placeholder** TTS character voices only; build the practice pack so the user can record in the morning. Do not spend long on voices.

## Pre-answered scope (same as SM64; do not ask)
- Keep as facts: decomp code/geometry/text, texture format+size+4x4 grid+2-bit alpha, sample length/rate/loops/coarse outline/median pitch, **note sequences** (melodies), demo inputs.
- Regenerate everything else. No retail pixels/samples in outputs. Taint scan must be 0 failing.
- **No voice cloning** of real actors, no models trained on retail audio (placeholders = Piper TTS, see cleanroom.voice.voices).
- Web route: see docs/DECOMP_PLAYBOOK.md §4. Prefer a PC port with Emscripten; otherwise **clean ROM + WASM N64 emulator**; N64Recomp+ports/wasm only as last resort. Decide within the first hour and log why.
- Publish when it boots, plays and taint passes: new public repo + gh-pages (gh CLI is logged in as andrewnakas). Push updates as you improve. Never publish dirty trees, dev builds, ROMs or retail clips.

## Where things are
- This folder: your repo. `cleanroom/` shared library (copy; extend freely here), `ports/`, `tools/`, `docs/DECOMP_PLAYBOOK.md` (**read first**, it is the checklist of traps), `docs/HARNESS.md` (PW64 lessons), `reference/sm64/` (the finished SM64 game module to copy patterns from: generate.py, drawn.py, facepaint briefs, paintings.py, level_render.py, voices).
- Work dirs: `D:/n64work/yoshistory/` (pristine, dirty, clean, build). Build on D: (C: is nearly full). **E: is unplugged**: the emsdk that lived at E:/n64web/emsdk is gone; if the chosen web route needs Emscripten, install emsdk once into the shared `D:/n64work/emsdk` (reuse it if another session already did).
- Toolchain: `tools/setup_winbin.sh` (zig cc as gcc, clang as `as`, llvm-objcopy, hexdump, python3, make). IDO 5.3 native: `C:/Users/andre/n64work/idowin` (see PW64 `tools/idowin`); IDO 7.1 if needed from ido-static-recomp releases (Windows builds). Zig: `~/.local/zig-x86_64-windows-0.16.0`, LLVM: `~/.local/clang+llvm-23.1.2-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc`.
- Python 3.12 with numpy, scipy, librosa, pyworld, piper-tts (voices: `C:/Users/andre/n64work/piper_voices`), faster-whisper, av, websocket-client.
- Browser checks: `python ports/wasm/serve.py <site> <port>` + `python ports/wasm/headless_shot.py <out> --base http://localhost:<port>/index.html --secs 5,10 --query "keys=..." --webgl`; hangs: `ports/wasm/cdp_stack.py`. Page template with dev hooks: `ports/web/shell.html`.

## How to work (token-minimal)
- Scripts print one-screen summaries; background long jobs and wait for the notification; one contact sheet per question; fixes as patch lists / JSON briefs.
- Clone decomps with `-c core.autocrlf=false -c core.eol=lf`.
- Keep `STATUS.md` current: what works, decisions, what's next, and a short "for the morning" list (what to record, what to look at).
- Commit often (end commit messages with `Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 5.5 (1M context) <noreply@anthropic.com>`).

## ROM / decomp
- ROM: C:/Users/andre/Downloads/Yoshi's Story (USA) (En,Ja).zip (unzip first; not on disk yet as of 2026-10-01)
- Decomp: https://github.com/decompals/yoshis-story (matching decomp, about 13 percent)

## Machine budget (several sessions share this PC)
- **Disk:** keep this game under ~8 GB on D: (`git clone --depth 1`, one dirty + one clean tree, delete stale build variants). Run `df -h /d` before big steps; under 10 GB free: stop heavy work, note "blocked on disk" in STATUS.md, do light work only.
- **Memory:** the PC ran out of RAM with ten sessions. Use `make -j4` (not -j12), one headless browser at a time, close servers when done, avoid loading whole ROM-sized arrays repeatedly.
- **ROM missing?** The user is fetching it: look for any matching file in C:/Users/andre/Downloads and in D:/ (root) each loop. Until it is there, do everything that needs no ROM (clone, toolchain, read the decomp's asset layout, choose the web route, write the game module), write "BLOCKED: ROM" plus the exact ROM revision / sha1 the decomp needs at the top of STATUS.md, and re-check every 20 minutes. Never download a ROM.
- **Partial decomp is fine:** the clean-ROM route only needs the decomp to build a matching ROM; undecompiled code stays as asm. What matters is finding every asset (also inside undecompiled blobs) and regenerating it. Donkey Kong 64 and Conker (D:/n64work/dk64-cleanroom, D:/n64work/conker-cleanroom, read-only reference) were done this way.
- **Voices:** build the practice pack as `D:/n64work/<id>/practice/` in the standard layout (`practice_<who>_call_and_response.wav`: clip, 0.3 s, 80 ms 880 Hz beep, gap 1.5x+1.5 s; `SCRIPT.txt` with `== <who>` sections). The user records with the Mac voice kit (D:/n64work/voicekit), which reads exactly that.
